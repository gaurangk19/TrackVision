Implemented a text generation system utilizing LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in TensorFlow, employing sequence modeling techniques to generate Shakespearean-style text.

Developed a robust data preprocessing pipeline using one-hot encoding and sequential sampling methodologies, transforming raw text into structured inputs for effective model training.

Trained the neural network on a subset of Shakespearean texts, incorporating temperature-based sampling technology to fine-tune output creativity and achieve realistic text generation.
